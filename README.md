# Bengaluru-house-price-prediction

This project aims to predict the real estate price and find the most influential factor on house price in Bengaluru, India. By doing feature engineering which is clean, complete and explore the dataset, we got useful insight and behavior of the real estate price in Bengaluru. Feature selection was put in to build the machine learning model that can predict the house price. I applied three algorithms, tuned hyperparameter to improve the model performance and selected the best one.
